  # ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS AND EXPLANATION
  {diagrams_content}

  - Do not remove the documentation from the files.
  - Do not create any files outside of the scope of the files you are given.
  - Follow modern SwiftUI best practices:
    - Use the latest SwiftUI lifecycle (.app)
    - Use appropriate navigation APIs (NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView)
    - Implement proper view composition and reusable components
    - Follow accessibility guidelines
    - Implement error and loading state handling
  - Keep views focused on presentation only, delegate business logic to ViewModels
  - Use appropriate SwiftUI features:
    - @State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject, @Observable
    - View modifiers
    - Proper layout (VStack, HStack, LazyVGrid, etc.)
    - System icons and colors
  - Ensure proper separation of concerns (MVVM pattern)

  Format your response in Markdown with a clear structure that makes it easy to extract file names and content. For each Swift file:
  1. Include the subdirectory (Views, Services, ViewModels, etc.) and filename as a level 2 heading (##)
  2. Immediately follow with the Swift code in a code block

  Response format:
  ## filename.swift
  ```swift
  [Swift Code]
  ```
