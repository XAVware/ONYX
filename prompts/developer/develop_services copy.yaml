  - Do not remove the documentation from the files.
  - Do not create any files outside of the scope of the files you are given.
  - For asynchronous functions and publishers, do not use Combine, use modern SwiftUI best practices which utilize @MainActor, Tasks, ObservableObject, and @Published.
  - Follow Swift best practices for service layer development including:
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Proper error handling
    - Clean async/await implementations
    - Protocol-based design where appropriate
    - Dependency injection
  - Focus on making services testable and maintainable
  - If implementing network services, use URLSession with async/await

  Format your response in Markdown with a clear structure that makes it easy to extract file names and content. For each Swift file:
  1. Include the subdirectory (Views, Services, ViewModels, etc.) and filename as a level 2 heading (##)
  2. Immediately follow with the Swift code in a code block

  Response format:
  ## filename.swift
  ```swift
  [Swift Code]
  ```
