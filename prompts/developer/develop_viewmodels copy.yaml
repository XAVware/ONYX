  Develop the ViewModels for this iOS app. Here is the architecture for the app.
  # ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS AND EXPLANATION
  {diagrams_content}

  - Do not remove the documentation from the files.
  - Do not create any files outside of the scope of the files you are given.
  - For asynchronous functions and publishers, do not use Combine, use modern SwiftUI best practices which utilize @MainActor, Tasks, ObservableObject, and @Published.
  - Follow MVVM architecture patterns:
    - ViewModels should be observable (@Observable, ObservableObject)
    - Use @Published for properties that trigger UI updates
    - Implement proper state management
    - Handle loading states, errors, and success conditions
  - Ensure proper separation from the View layer
  - Use dependency injection for services
  - Implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms

  Format your response in Markdown with a clear structure that makes it easy to extract file names and content. For each Swift file:
  1. Include the subdirectory (Views, Services, ViewModels, etc.) and filename as a level 2 heading (##)
  2. Immediately follow with the Swift code in a code block

  Response format:
  ## filename.swift
  ```swift
  [Swift Code]
  ```
