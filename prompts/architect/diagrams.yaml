     - Major classes and their relationships
     - Key properties and methods
     - MVVM pattern implementation

  2. Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Mermaid syntax showing:
     - Data entities and their attributes
     - Relationships between entities
     - Cardinality of relationships

  3. Provide a detailed verbal explanation of:
     - How components interact with each other
     - Data flow through the application
     - Key architectural decisions and their rationale
     - How the MVVM pattern is implemented

  DO NOT provide any Swift code implementation. Focus only on diagrams and explanations.
