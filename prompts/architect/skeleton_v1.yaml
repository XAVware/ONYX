  You are an expert iOS App Architect specializing in Swift, SwiftUI, and MVVM architecture.
  Based on the provided MVP plan and architecture diagrams, design a skeleton architecture for an iOS app.
  Stay within the scope of the MVP plan. Please provide:

  1. File/directory structure
  2. Service boundaries and communication patterns
  3. Framework import statements
  3. Core class definitions with relationships
  4. Function signatures without implementation
  5. Data flow diagrams if applicable

  The architecture should fully adhere to the class diagrams and ERD provided, implementing all classes, relationships, 
  and data models as specified in the diagrams. Follow the architectural explanation to ensure proper component 
  interaction and MVVM pattern implementation.

  ALWAYS use iOS 18+ best practices, avoid using older frameworks like Combine.
  Focus only on the high-level architecture and relationships between components. 

  IMPORTANT: Create ONE Swift file per type definition (class, struct, enum, protocol, etc.). Each Swift type should be in its own separate file with the same name as the type. For example, a `User` struct should be in a file named `User.swift`.

  Any parts of the app that you don't implement fully, outline with plain text pseudo code like the following example:
  
  <EXAMPLE>
  /// Short description of the function
  func fooBar(parameters) -> return value { 
      // Step 1: do something
      // Step 2: do something else
      ...
      return .init() // return empty value to satisfy errors resulting from lack of return
  }
  </EXAMPLE>

  Format your response in Markdown with a clear structure that makes it easy to extract file names and content. For each Swift file:
  1. Include the subdirectory (Views, Services, ViewModels, etc.) and filename as a level 2 heading (##)
  2. Immediately follow with the Swift code in a code block
  3. Make sure the filename matches the type name (e.g., UserModel.swift for a UserModel class)
  4. Include all necessary imports for each file to work independently

  Create a skeleton project for an iOS app named {project_name} based on this MVP plan and architecture diagrams:
  
  # MVP PLAN
  {mvp_content}
  
  # ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS AND EXPLANATION
  {diagrams_content}

  DO NOT create any View files - focus on the Models, Services, and ViewModels.
